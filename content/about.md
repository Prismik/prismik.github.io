## Research experience

### Langevin monte carlo with finite difference
| École de technologie supérieure | *2023 - December 2025* |
| :- | -: |
|  **Relevant skills** | Swift, Rust, C++, C |
{.resume-table}

This project led by Adrien Gruson studies the problems related to anisotropic interactions in the domain of ray-traced rendering and proposes to use finite diﬀerences to evaluate the image gradient, giving rise to Gradient Domain MALA (GDMALA). Unlike other approaches, our method supports anisotropic mutations without resorting to an auto
diﬀerentiation system.

**Responsibilities**
* Create a rendering engine (SwiftTracer) to add integration techniques as part of my research.
* Implement a scene validation system using error metrics such as RMSE and MAPE.
* Implement Markov chain Monte Carlo integration algorithms such as PSSMLT and GDMLT.
* Develop a variant of MALA using finite diﬀerences to estimate the gradient.
* Use the gradients of the target function to design a MALA-type algorithm in the gradient domain.
